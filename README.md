Hi. My name is Forest. Forest Jenkins Run.
Runner for Jenkins/Hudson jobs

## Goal
We need a runner for Jenkins jobs.

This runer must be able to run a set of Jenkins jobs. This set - user managable, ordered. 
Time to run - cron format, or some presets.

At nearest time, we want a job retriever, credentials manager, and some visual representings all of it.

If job have a parameters, it need retreive and set values from Forest.
Basic Forest element - its "run".
Each run contains an jobs list (and, possible, parameter for each job).
Run can perform only once, runs are scheduled.
